HW 1: 

Introduction:
	Name: Robert Wes Ludwig
	Degree Program: B.Sc. Bioinformatics - Computational Biology
	Research Interests: Simulation of biomolecules, Nucleic Acid Sequencing and Genomics
	Programming Skill: Most experience with Python, Java, and Perl; starting to learn C now
	Experience with Scientific Computing: Worked with David Minh using his AlGDock program to determine ligand binding to bioengineered nanopores
	What I want to learn: I'd like to come out of this class beign able to write parrallel algorithms in pseudocode, this understanding is more important to me than syntax-specific knowledge. I'd like to be able to apply the logic of parralellization to any problems I come across in my scientific career.
